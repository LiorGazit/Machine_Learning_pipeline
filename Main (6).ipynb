    "1. Exploring the data  \n",
    "1. Feature engineering  \n",

    "## The Data:\n",
    "A data set from ??? that holds texts and a class for each.  \n",
    "There are 8 total classes for this set, so the appropriate solution is a NLP-ML classifier.\n",

    "## Approach:\n",
    "A simple generic ML approach.  \n",
    "Meaning, I don't leverage any NLP-dedicated models (like BERT or GPT3).  \n",
    "But rather I design numerical features for the various text terms (One Hot Encoding/Bag of Words/TFIDF), and pipe them into generic ML models.  \n",
